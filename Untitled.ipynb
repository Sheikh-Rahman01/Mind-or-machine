    "With the rise of advanced language models like ChatGPT, Gemini and other AI tools, distinguishing between AI-generated text and human-written content has become increasingly difficult. This poses a significant challenge in areas such as academia, journalism, and digital content verification where authenticity matters. The key concern is the ability to detect the origin of the text accurately to prevent misuse, ensure academic honesty, and maintain content integrity. This project aims to build a machine learning-based classifier that can automatically determine whether a given sentence, paragraph, or document is written by a human or generated by AI, enabling users and organizations to verify authenticity of textual data efficiently.\n"

Some Schools offter distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students can ncreased to learn at home. Also is more hard to students understand by online. students get distract at home. Some schools in United States ofter classes from home because is good option to students . Also students can stay more relaxing from home. Students don't want to go more at school and they want to get classes at home. Students get fall in environment learning. But students can get relaxing at home.\\n\\nStudents can get distract at home because they have easy to use phones. If students sleep in class they want to sleep at home too. They feel more bored at home because they need stay at home more time. Also students don't do anything at home because if they stay at home is esay to get more distract. Students can get fall in environment learning and is hard they learn at home. Students have more time to do homework. Also they don't want to learn by online. Also many students have hard time in class to understand that teacher explain in more hard they learn at home.\\n\\nSome schools affter classes from home because they think is good option to students.

Ultimately, this decision will depend on the individual student and their ability to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.. \\n\\nHowever, in the end, the effect that home-based classes will have on learning is largely dependent on the situation of the student. On the other hand, there could be a lack of social interaction with classmates, a lack of guidance from instructors, and potential technical issues as well. For example, those who are already motivated to learn and are self-disciplined may reap the full benefits of studying in the comfort of their own home. Conversely, for those who require more interaction and guidance that comes with physical classrooms, a home-based learning style may not be as effective. On the one hand, it eliminates the need for physical attendance to classrooms, reduces the psychology of peer pressure, and eliminates potential health risks resulting from attending crowded places. In addition, students have the opportunity to arrange their learning environment according to their preferences and better manage their own time. \\nWhen considering the pros and cons of attending classes from home, there is no doubt that there are a variety of advantages and disadvantages', 'instructions': 'Task: Write a persuasive essay on whether or not classes from home should be offered as an option for students to attend. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of attending classes from home, as well as the effect it may have on learning. Cite examples to support your argument.'}\n"
